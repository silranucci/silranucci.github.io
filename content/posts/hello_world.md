Welcome to my space on the internet!

I have been thinking about starting a personal blog for about two years now. Nothing too serious - just a place to share
what I am learning. There's no set publishing plan and no strict theme. The only sure thing is that I will write
about a variety of computer science topics.

Stay tuned.

See you soon!
